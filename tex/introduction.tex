systems such as gases, liquids and solids "


Kjetils notater:
Simulere bevegelse N atomer og molekyler basert på klassisk newtonsk dynamikk: $ F_i = m\dv{ri}{t}  = - \pdv{U}{r:i}$. Kraften er ofte sterkt avstandsavhengig og kan komme fra eks. Lennard Jones potensial.  \cite{article_A_Hands-On_Introduction_to_Molecular_Dynamics}.


Fysikk:

Material science:
	Can use potentials dervied from non-relativistic Schrödinger equation to investigate lattic and defect dynamics at atomistic scale. \cite{materialphysics}

Kjemi:
	behavoiur ideal gas, chemical reacton $ A + A \rightarrow B+B $ with hard sphere potential and Lennard Jones potential, \cite{GORECKI1989245}
	
Bio:
	Simulate membranes
Molecular dynamics—the science of simulating the motions of a system of particles—applied to biological macromolecules gives the fluctuations in the relative positions of the atoms in a protein or in DNA as a function of time. Knowledge of these motions provides insights into biological phenomena such as the role of flexibility in ligand binding and the rapid solvation of the electron transfer state in photosynthesis. Molecular dynamics is also being used to determine protein structures from NMR \cite{biology}
