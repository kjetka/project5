Molecular dynamics is a numerical method to simulate the movement of atoms and molecules based on classical Newtonian dynamics. The method can be used to study many-particle systems of molecules, clusters and macroscopic systems as solids, liquids and gases, such as in this project. It is used in different science fields. It can be used in material science with non-relativistic Schr√∂dinger equation to investigate lattice and defect dynamics \cite{materialphysics}. In chemistry it can be used to see the behaviour of ideal gases and chemical reactions with hard sphere potential and Lennard Jones potential \cite{GORECKI1989245}. It can be used to simulate behavior at membranes in biology, fluctuations of biological marcomolecules and to determine protein structures from NMR \cite{biology}.
